# Welcome
This contains various versions of the data and model work that was created in writing my seminar paper (final research paper in my undergrad). 
The python work contains some of the data work and the code used to create the error correction model. 
The paper is also included as a PDF. The paper goes over house price dynamics in Canada at the the aggregate level. 

A two-good agent optimization problem is presented and used to derive the fundemental equation for house prices. 
Then an error correction model is used to observe house price dynamics and whether prices are overvalued in Canada, from the 
Financial Crisis to the COVID-19 pandemic.
